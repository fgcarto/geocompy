        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter is about reading and writing geographic data.\n",
        "Geographic data input is essential for geocomputation: real-world applications are impossible without data.\n",
        "Data output is also vital, enabling others to use valuable new or improved datasets resulting from your work.\n",
        "Taken together, these processes of input/output can be referred to as data I/O.\n",
        "\n",
        "Geographic data I/O is often done with few lines of code at the beginning and end of projects.\n",
        "It is often overlooked as a simple one-step process.\n",
        "However, mistakes made at the outset of projects (e.g., using an out-of-date or in some way faulty dataset) can lead to large problems later down the line, so it is worth putting considerable time into identifying which datasets are available, where they can be found and how to retrieve them.\n",
        "These topics are covered in @sec-retrieving-open-data, which describes several geoportals, which collectively contain many terabytes of data, and how to use them.\n",
        "To further ease data access, a number of packages for downloading geographic data have been developed, as demonstrated in @sec-geographic-data-packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many geographic file formats, each of which has pros and cons, described in @sec-file-formats.\n",
        "The process of reading and writing files efficiently is covered in Sections @sec-data-input and @sec-data-output, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Retrieving open data {#sec-retrieving-open-data}\n",
        "\n",
        "A vast and ever-increasing amount of geographic data is available on the internet, much of which is free to access and use (with appropriate credit given to its providers)[^07-read-write-plot-1].\n",
        "In some ways there is now too much data, in the sense that there are often multiple places to access the same dataset.\n",
        "Some datasets are of poor quality.\n",
        "In this context, it is vital to know where to look, so the first section covers some of the most important sources.\n",
        "Various 'geoportals' (web services providing geospatial datasets, such as Data.gov[^data_gov]) are a good place to start, providing a wide range of data but often only for specific locations (as illustrated in the updated Wikipedia page[^wiki_geoportal] on the topic).\n",

        "The GEOSS portal[^geoss_portal] and the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem[^copernicus], for example, contain many raster datasets with global coverage.\n",
        "A wealth of vector datasets can be accessed from the SEDAC[^sedac] portal run by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Union's INSPIRE geoportal[^inspire_geoportal], with global and regional coverage.\n",

        "Most geoportals provide a graphical interface allowing datasets to be queried based on characteristics such as spatial and temporal extent, the United States Geological Survey's EarthExplorer[^earthexplorer] and NASA's EarthData Search[^earthdata_search] being prime examples.\n",
        "Exploring datasets interactively on a browser is an effective way of understanding available layers.\n",
        "From reproducibility and efficiency perspectives, downloading data is, however, best done with code.\n",
        "Downloads can be initiated from the command line using a variety of techniques, primarily via URLs and APIs (see the Sentinel API[^sentinel_api], for example).\n",

        "Furthermore, ESRI Shapefile does not support all possible geometry types, for example, it is unable to distinguish between a polygon and a multipolygon.\n",
        "Despite these limitations, a viable alternative had been missing for a long time.\n",
