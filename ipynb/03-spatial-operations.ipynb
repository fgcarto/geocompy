        "Spatial operations, including spatial joins between vector datasets and local and focal operations on raster datasets, are a vital part of geocomputation. \n",
        "This chapter shows how spatial objects can be modified in a multitude of ways based on their location and shape. Many spatial operations have a non-spatial (attribute) equivalent, so concepts such as subsetting and joining datasets demonstrated in the previous chapter are applicable here.\n",
        "This is especially true for vector operations: @sec-vector-attribute-manipulation on vector attribute manipulation provides the basis for understanding its spatial counterpart, namely spatial subsetting (covered in @sec-spatial-subsetting-vector). \n",
        "Spatial joining (@sec-spatial-joining) and aggregation (@sec-vector-spatial-aggregation) also have non-spatial counterparts, covered in the previous chapter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Spatial operations differ from non-spatial operations in a number of ways, however. \n",
        "Spatial joins, for example, can be done in a number of ways---including matching entities that intersect with or are within a certain distance of the target dataset---while the attribution joins discussed in @sec-vector-attribute-joining in the previous chapter can only be done in one way.\n",
        "Different types of spatial relationships between objects, including intersects and disjoints, are described in @sec-topological-relations.\n",
        "Another unique aspect of spatial objects is distance: all spatial objects are related through space, and distance calculations can be used to explore the strength of this relationship, as described in the context of vector data in @sec-distance-relations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Spatial operations on raster objects include subsetting---covered in @sec-spatial-subsetting-raster---and merging several raster 'tiles' into a single object, as demonstrated in @sec-merging-rasters.\n",
        "Map algebra covers a range of operations that modify raster cell values, with or without reference to surrounding cell values.\n",
        "The concept of map algebra, vital for many applications, is introduced in @sec-map-algebra; local, focal, and zonal map algebra operations are covered in sections @sec-raster-local-operations, @sec-focal-operations, and @sec-zonal-operations, respectively. \n",
        "Global map algebra operations, which generate summary statistics representing an entire raster dataset, and distance calculations on rasters, are discussed in Section @sec-global-operations-and-distances.\n",
        "\n",
        "::: callout-note\n",
        "It is important to note that spatial operations that use two spatial objects rely on both objects having the same coordinate reference system, a topic that was introduced in @sec-coordinate-reference-systems-intro and which will be covered in more depth in @sec-reproj-geo-data. \n",

        "\n",
        "Spatial subsetting is the process of taking a spatial object and returning a new object containing only features that relate in space to another object.\n",
        "Analogous to attribute subsetting (covered in @sec-vector-attribute-subsetting), subsets of `GeoDataFrame`s can be created with square bracket (`[`) operator using the syntax `x[y]`, where `x` is an `GeoDataFrame` from which a subset of rows/features will be returned, and `y` is a boolean `Series`.\n",
        "The difference is, that, in spatial subsetting `y` is created based on another geometry and using one of the binary geometry relation methods, such as `.intersects` (see @sec-topological-relations), rather than based on comparison based on ordinary columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "To demonstrate spatial subsetting, we will use the `nz` and `nz_height` layers, which contain geographic data on the 16 main regions and 101 highest points in New Zealand, respectively (@fig-spatial-subset (a)), in a projected coordinate system.\n",
        "The following expression creates a new object, `canterbury`, representing only one region --- Canterbury."

        "Global operations are a special case of zonal operations with the entire raster dataset representing a single zone.\n",

        "\n",
        "Aside from that, global operations are also useful for the computation of distance and weight rasters.\n",
        "In the first case, one can calculate the distance from each cell to specific target cells or vector geometries.\n",
        "For example, one might want to compute the distance to the nearest coast (see @sec-distance-to-nearest-geometry).\n",
        "We might also want to consider topography, that means, we are not only interested in the pure distance but would like also to avoid the crossing of mountain ranges when going to the coast.\n",
        "To do so, we can weight the distance with elevation so that each additional altitudinal meter 'prolongs' the Euclidean distance (this is beyond the scope of the book).\n",

        "Overlaying two rasters (local operation), where one contains 'No Data' values representing a mask, is similar to vector clipping (Section @sec-clipping).\n",
        "Quite similar to spatial clipping is intersecting two layers (@sec-spatial-subsetting-vector, @sec-joining-incongruent-layers).\n",
        "The difference is that these two layers (vector or raster) simply share an overlapping area.\n",
        "However, be careful with the wording.\n",
        "Sometimes the same words have slightly different meanings for raster and vector data models.\n",
        "While aggregating polygon geometries means dissolving boundaries, for raster data geometries it means increasing cell sizes and thereby reducing spatial resolution.\n",

        "Such computations rely on remotely sensed information.\n",
        "The corresponding source imagery is often divided into scenes covering a specific spatial extent (i.e., tiles), and frequently, a study area covers more than one scene.\n",
        "Then, we would need to merge (also known as mosaic) the scenes covering our study area.\n",
        "In case when all scenes are aligned (i.e., share the same origin and resolution), this can be thought of as simply gluing them into one big raster; otherwise, all scenes need to be resampled (see @sec-raster-resampling) to the same grid (e.g., the one defined by the first scene).\n",
