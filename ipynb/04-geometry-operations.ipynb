        "So far the book has explained the structure of geographic datasets (@sec-spatial-class), and how to manipulate them based on their non-geographic attributes (@sec-attr) and spatial relations (@sec-spatial-operations).\n",
        "This chapter focuses on manipulating the geographic elements of geographic objects, for example by simplifying and converting vector geometries, and by cropping raster datasets.\n",
        "After reading it you should understand and have control over the geometry column in vector layers and the extent and geographic location of pixels represented in rasters in relation to other geographic objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "@sec-geo-vec covers transforming vector geometries with 'unary' and 'binary' operations.\n",
        "Unary operations work on a single geometry in isolation, including simplification (of lines and polygons), the creation of buffers and centroids, and shifting/scaling/rotating single geometries using 'affine transformations' (@sec-simplification to @sec-affine-transformations).\n",
        "Binary transformations modify one geometry based on the shape of another, including clipping and geometry unions, covered in @sec-clipping and @sec-geometry-unions, respectively.\n",
        "Type transformations (from a polygon to a line, for example) are demonstrated in Section @sec-type-transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "@sec-geo-ras covers geometric transformations on raster objects.\n",
        "This involves changing the size and number of the underlying pixels, and assigning them new values.\n",
        "It teaches how to change the extent and the origin of a raster manually (@sec-extent-and-origin), how to change the resolution in fixed steps through aggregation and disaggregation (@sec-raster-agg-disagg), and finally how to resample a raster into any existing template, which is the most general and often most practical approach (@sec-raster-resampling).\n",
        "These operations are especially useful if one would like to align raster datasets from diverse sources.\n",
        "Aligned raster objects share a one-to-one correspondence between pixels, allowing them to be processed using map algebra operations (@sec-raster-local-operations).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next chapter (@sec-raster-vector), we deal with the special case of geometry operations that involve both a raster and a vector layer together.\n",
        "It shows how raster values can be 'masked' and 'extracted' by vector geometries.\n",
        "Importantly it shows how to 'polygonize' rasters and 'rasterize' vector datasets, making the two data models more interchangeable.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Geometric operations on vector data {#sec-geo-vec}\n",
        "\n",
        "This section is about operations that in some way change the geometry of vector layers.\n",
        "It is more advanced than the spatial data operations presented in the previous chapter (in @sec-spatial-vec), because here we drill down into the geometry: the functions discussed in this section work on the geometric part (the geometry column, which is a `GeoSeries` object), either as standalone object or as part of a `GeoDataFrame`.\n",

        "Another reason for simplifying objects is to reduce the amount of memory, disk space, and network bandwidth they consume: it may be wise to simplify complex geometries before publishing them as interactive maps.\n",
        "The **geopandas** package provides the `.simplify` method, which uses the GEOS implementation of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm to reduce the vertex count.\n",
